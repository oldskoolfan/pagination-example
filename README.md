# CSCI 2412 - Pagination Example

This example uses basic query params to show how we can
do pagination with MySQL's OFFSET and LIMIT arguments.

We are using [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) to generate some random names for this example.

The easiest way to install, as indicated in Faker's README,
is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). If you aren't familiar with it, please see their documentation for a great introduction on using it.
